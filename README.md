Hello there! :wave:

My name is Fabricio and I'm currently and undergraduate chemical engineering student attending University of Waterloo 📚


I like coding new projects, especially involving Python!  

I'm not afraid of troubleshooting until the problem is solved ⚙️

I have experience programming to organize large amounts of data
