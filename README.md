Hello there! :wave:

My name is Fabricio and I'm currently and undergraduate chemical engineering student at University of Waterloo 📚 
Here is a little about me:

• I have experience programming, organizing industrial data, and displaying it on dashboards. Excel, PowerBi, and PiSystem Explorer and PIVision are some programs I worked with in the past 🔧

• Designed a game inspired by the iconic Snake game and programmed a thermocouple reader using an Arduino. As well as saves data on excel (at intervals of 1 second). 

• I strive to work on new projects, especially Python related! ✔️
