Hello there! :wave:

My name is Fabricio and I'm currently and undergraduate chemical engineering student attending University of Waterloo 📚

I have experience programming, organizing industrial data, and displaying it on dashboards. Excel, PowerBi, and PiSystem Explorer are some programs I worked with in the past.
Designed games on Python and coded functions for an Arduino to execute. Measuring temperature and saving data on excel to name a few. 

I like working on new projects, especially Python related!
